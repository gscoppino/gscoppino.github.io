              A personal safety application and hub created for a Software Engineering capstone project.
              It was a team-based, full semester project designed from the ground up from client requirements
              elicited over the course of the semester. It touched upon most aspects of the Software Engineering Life
              Cycle and required documentation at all stages, which had to be signed off by two Software Engineering
              professors. The product utilized an SQL database for data persistence and utilized Amazon Web Services
              for PaaS content delivery and services such as Amazon SNS. The product consisted of a NodeJS
              backend (utilizing the Express framework), and an iOS application written with Swift.

              A double-entry accounting web application created for a senior-level Software Engineering course.
              It was a team-based, full semester project, developed through an Agile SCRUM process that touched
              upon most aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle. Initial project requirements were provided
              at the beginning of the semester, which were clarified, expanded upon, and revised through weekly
              requirements elicitation sessions with the professor. Documentation was required at all stages of the
              project, and bi-weekly progress reports and class presentations were required. The product utilized
              an SQL database for  data persistence and an Apache web server for content delivery, and was written
              with a Python REST  backend (utilizing the Django Framework), and a JavaScript SPA frontend
              (utilizing the React library). The web application was deployed to a DigitalOcean VPS at the end
              of the semester.

              A project management web application created for a junior-level Software Engineering course. It was
              a team-based project that touched upon several aspects of the Software Development
              Life Cycle, with a focus on overall project management. The product was written with a PHP backend,
              and a JavaScript SPA frontend that utilized the React library.

              A website simulating a library's online presence, created for a introductory Software Engineering
              course. It was a team-based project that lightly touched upon many aspects of the Software Development
              life cycle. Documentation was written and delivered for several phases of the project life cycle. The
              website utilized a MySQL database, an Apache web server for content delivery, and was written with
              Python (utilizing the Django Framework).

              An auctioning website created for a Database Systems course. The focus of the project was on
              proper database design and interaction. It utilized an MS-SQL database, with an ASP.NET WebForms
              application serving the web pages. JavaScript was used minimally where dynamic client side
              functionality was needed.

              A website that provided a per-school catalog of items that users of the system could
              buy, sell, and trade. The website also had a messaging system for communication between users, and
              an Android application built on a second-generation API focused on JSON delivery.
              It was a team project developed by friends of mine that I volunteered to help with. The project
              was a learning experience with regards to marketing, acceptance testing, and working with a multi-faceted
              team. It utilized a MySQL database, with a backend written in PHP, and JavaScript frontend
              code providing dynamic content and interactions. Personally, I spearheaded a mobile version of the
              website HTML and CSS, with a custom SPA JavaScript frontend built utilizing the second-generation
              JSON API's developed by the project's lead backend developer (with some API work occasionally done by me).

              A client side web application written in AngularJS. It allows the user to configure events that
              occur on one or more days of the week and see the resulting schedule of the week. It was developed
              to rapidly test potential class schedules without actually signing up for classes.
