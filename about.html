        <h2>Early Days</h2>
        <p>
          I began programming by working through the first chapters of
          <a class="external-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081106175456/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/" target="_blank">
            The C Programming Language
          </a>
          as a child, and creating simple BASIC programs. As a teenager, I became enamored with studying and modifying
          source code for open-source homebrew software on relevant game consoles at the time, which helped introduce me
          to basic concepts of operating systems, graphics programming, scripting, and game development. I enrolled in
          programming courses in high school, where I learned Visual Basic .NET and later, the Java programming
          language. I enrolled in Southern Polytechnic State University (which later merged with Kennesaw State University)
          in Fall 2012, initially majoring in Computer Engineering to explore an interest in embedded systems.
          I found myself only enjoying the software aspects of the program, and instead graduated from Kennesaw State
          University with a B.S. of Software Engineering in the Fall of 2017.
        </p>
        <h2>Concentration</h2>
        <p>
          My concentration is in web applications development. I began by creating simple web portals using very basic
          HTML and CSS. A year after starting university, I was employed by GTRI to work on web applications. Between my
          employment, my coursework, and personal/volunteer projects, I got to learn the ins and outs of full stack
          web development. I've worked with SQL and NoSQL databases, have written server code in a variety of programming
          languages, and developed web clients using a variety of frameworks and approaches.
        </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I also enjoy programming at a hobbyist level. I am interested in embedded systems programming, traditional
          desktop/mobile application development, and 2D/3D game development, among others. I strive to be a
          well-rounded programmer overall.
